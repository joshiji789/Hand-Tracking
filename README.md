# Hand-Tracking
A lot of progress is being made in machine learning every day.  A very popular and very useful machine learning application is Hand Tracking. The algorithm uses machine learning (ML) to infer 21 3D landmarks in a single frame. To interface with the photos and videos, we used the openCV library, while to model the program, we used the MediaPipe library.
